# expatrio_coding_challenge

The app starts with the login page and the user signs in with his credentials...
After that, the user moved to the next page where he needed to add the TID number.

Things to consider:
  1-  In case you have faced an error related to the Gradle version please downgrade the Gradle version to 7.4
  you can do that by going to "project name/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties"
  
  2-  The project is running on the last dart version so make sure to update before.
  
  3-  You can find the updated version of the code on the Master branch.
